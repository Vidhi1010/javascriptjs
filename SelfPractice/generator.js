//Generators are special functions that you can pause and resume anytime.
//Normally, a function runs from start → end, continuous. But a generator runs step-by-step and can give you values one by one.

//yield keyword to pause and return value

///////////////////      Use of generator       ///////////////

//1. To create custom iterators  (E.g. infinite sequence, fibonacci)
//2. To control async code (before async/await existed)
//3. To generate values on demand (lazy evaluation)
//4. To avoid memory-heavy arrays

//Question: What is itrator pattern in js?
//Question: What is Yield Keyword?
